========================
 Barcelona presentation
========================

9:00 - 9:30: Short intro talk
9:30 - 10:00: Stock type along, with simple exercises

- Create a mask of dates in a given year (say 2010).  Slice  the recarray to
  read off only data for this year.

- Define daily return:

  (today's price - yesterday's price)/(yesterday's price)

  Find mean, max, stdev and compare to the same for the whole dataset.

- Serial autocorrelation: correlate offset by one day.


10:00 - 10:10: Numpy slides
10:10 - 10:20: Trapezoid rule problem
10:20 - 11:00: Barcelona image exercise and problems.

- We load the data and explain the structure of the array.

- We use imshow on whole image.

- We Compute luminosity image, display as grayscale.

- Ask them to display each channel as a separate image. Hint: cm.Reds,...

- We show them a 1-d histogram of random numbers.

- Ask them to get luminosity histogram.  Hint: .flatten()

- We show them the full solution.


11:00 - 11:30: Coffee break

11:30 - 12:00: Worfklow: debugging, documentation, help.

Bug: is volume correlated with daily return?

Matplotlib overview: gallery, codex, math text typesetting, formats.

12:00 - 12:30: f2py.

12:30 - 1:00: Random walks, plotting and fitting.
