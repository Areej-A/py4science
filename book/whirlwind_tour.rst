There is an enormous breadth and depth of packages supporting
scientific computing in python -- the packages in scipy alone could
fill several books worth of documentation -- and we will dive into
this material in some depth in chapters to come.  Before going deep
though, we'd like to start showing how easy it is to do common tasks
in scientific computing using just a few core tools: the python
standard library, numpy, matplotlib, scipy and the ipython shell.
