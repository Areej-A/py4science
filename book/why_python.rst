 Why Python for scientific computing

    Notes for this chapter, mostly reminders for myself.  These can be toggled
    off via the todo_include_todos flag in conf.py.
    
    - Write a bit more about the history of computing in science?
    - How much to go back on computer language details?
    - How much history of Python to put in?

From their very inception computers have been linked to scientific work, so it
is worth noting that there is more than a bit of irony in the phrase
"Scientific Computing" we use today.  The very first electronic computers were
immediately used for solving differential equations and other problems that
required  large amounts of easy but repetitive numerical operations, a task
that was both slow and error prone (fperez - find Feynman's original
description of Los Alamos computation rooms).
