======================
Our first book project
======================

Welcome to the first py4science book project.

Intro stuff
-------------

* why python

* getting started

* whirlwind tour: simple 2d array load, stock demo, images, some
  numerical examples like ODE/interp/PDFs

* numpy arrays

In depth stuff
-----------------

* workflow : docs, testing, client version control

* software carpentry: version control, unit testing, buildbots, code
  review


* web data: scraping (yahoo finances), apis (fred, opendap),
  structured data and url reverse engineering (yahoo historical
  prices, google insight)

* mapping data: weather, geofred


TODO
====

* Make a :cite:`key1,key2` rest extension to process bibtex.



Conventions
===============

* When importing modules, use the following syntax:

    import matplotlib.mlab as mlab

  rather than

    from matplotlib import mlab

  The first is unambiguously a module -- the 2nd could be a module,
  function, or contstant


* When referring to a function, class or module, link to the API docs
  in the first usage, after than use double backticks.


* Don't use print w/o parens as it is not 3.0 safe
