Book vision
===========

Audience?

- Brian: undergrads, but also other faculty.
- John: incoming programmers, graduates in CS/math/physics.

Parallel computing stuff: separate book?


Focus:
- tools?
- algorithms?
- tasks?

- classroom textbook?

Date                                                 Content
Aug 30  Informal Python Q&A (geared towards Boot Camp graduates)
Sept 13  scipy, numpy, stats  
Sept 20  interacting with the world (xml-rpc, urllib, sending and receiving
email, serial)
Sept 27   (matplotlib) Advanced plotting and data vizualization, mayavi  
Oct 4  database interaction, large datasets (HDF5)
Oct 11  GUI (Tkinter, GTK, Traits)  
Oct 18  Advanced versioning, application building (optparse), debugging & testing
Oct 25  web-framework (CGI), Django, App Engine, mod-python, cgi
Nov 1  parallelization (ipython), cuda
Nov 8  wrapper around legacy code -- FORTRAN, C, etc.
Nov 22    Symbolic & mathematical programming: simpy, sage, R  
Onward  final project work


Organize by topic, then revisit the topic with each tool.

Target length: 300 pages, 400 absolute max.

Finishing the book
==================

Status: 3/4 chapters in reasonable shape.

HPC chapter: bullet points to text would make it nearly complete.

Brian: parallel computing stuff would make a book by itself.
